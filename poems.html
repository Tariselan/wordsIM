            <p>
                there are many Instruments I play<br>
                I make music, I create [], build worlds.<br>
                to hear colours, to see dreams, I listen to the<br>
                voices of many, I am a scribe using the hand of old.<br>
                My garments aren't that of now, for they are passèd down.<br>
                I am the next hand to hold them, the second of many,<br>
                for it means beaucoup d'amour à moi<br>
                second hand is the only hand I need.
            </p>
            <h2>2.</h2>
            <p>
                the tiny kitten, el gatito pequeño, le petit chaton!<br>
                je l'adore très beaucoup. il est très magnifique!<br>
                ¿Soy avec el gato? no, but you & redacted redacted are w/ her.<br>
                such a beautiful cat, you get to pat her<br>
                j'adore tous les deux des vous<br>
                ma vie en le passé etait difficile, mais en ce moment,<br>
                maintenent?<br>
                tu have made me o so joyous, for that I rejoice<br>
                triumphantly. I call to every trump from east to west,<br>
                and say merrily,<br>
                <br>
                'Danke danke danke, mi amigo, for everything;<br>
                merci, gracias & thankq.'

            <h2>3.</h2>
            <p>
                Perfection is in the eye of the beholder.<br>
                But true perfection stays all but wothout character<br>
                My love does not fall for what myne eyes may see<br>
                J'adore la personne for whom their flaws here bestown upon mi eyes<br>
                I do not care for such a lack of impurities<br>
                For all is music in mine eyes<br>
                J'adore toi beaucoup for your voice is music<br>
                from the heavens in my ears.
            </p>
            <h2>4.</h2>
            <p>
                chère [redacted],<br>
                je comprend beaucoup des choses<br>
                je comprend la mathematique; la musique; les phonetiques<br>
                however, there is one thing I truly cannot understand<br>
                je ne comprend pas mes sentimennts et mon amour pour toi at all<br>
                pour moi, they elude my words, for I wish to try<br>
                and paint a picture to let you see mon amour pour toi<br>
                but, like a cloud of mysetery or a thick mist lets them<br>
                hide, my words not able to capture a single photo of tout de mon amour.<br>
                te amo tres times over.<br>
                I wish dearly that mayhap, one day you may sit here<br>
                and finally see the sunset for thee
            </p>
            <h2>5.</h2>
            <p>
                un petit peu de joyeux<br>
                every day, thunder or shine, light falls upon my face.<br>
                not the light of lamp, nor that of a bulb,<br>
                but rather one of joy.<br>
                when I even begin to think of thee,<br>
                'tis like I am living dans un rêve<br>
                for which I get un petit peu de joyeux
            </p>
            <h2>6.</h2>
            <p>
                I dreamt once, now I also dream.<br>
                I used to think I saw things a near,<br>
                but now I hear the colours with my eyes<br>
                Such a life I lived defies so much to the life I must live<br>
                A match stricken, set aflame, is not put in a box<br>
                why shouldst I?<br>
                Thou wilt say unto me, 'but why, why dost thou say as such?'<br>
                and I will give thee an answer,<br>
                'out of love, my dear, out of love.'
            </p>
            <h2>7.</h2>
            <p>
                Dear redacted,<br>
                J'adore toi muy beaucoup<br>
                Love is but a mystery known unto all but me<br>
                But somehow, whenever I'm in presence of thee,<br>
                my thoughts become free<br>
                Every day, I feel lost in here, yet,<br>
                although I need a map, I had it all along<br>
                O ye people of the realms above, forgive me<br>
                not for my blindness, but my refusal to listen to ye.
            </p>
            <h2>8.</h2>
            <p>
                I adore the rain.<br>
                J'adore the sounds it makes against my window,<br>
                the way is ceases all sense of disaster.<br>
                J'adore the way the light softens on the word.<br>
                What I like most about it now? Is the way it reminds me of them.<br>
                The way they both seem to make the world better,<br>
                more peaceful,<br>
                calmer,<br>
                happier.<br>
                But one thing sets them apart; she makes the world brighter.<br>
                Whereas the clouds darken the sky,<br>
                her voice & presence only brighten the room.<br>
                Where the cold pouring rain leaves eventually from my head,<br>
                He never leaves from mine hart and their warm glow seems<br>
                to keep me like a wee lad near a fire.<br>
                I love her so, no matter how words may wander,<br>
                how geese may gander, nor Danes be invaded.<br>
                Forever shall I love & yearn for a way to tell you,<br>
                truly just how much I love you.
            </p>

                L'eau de the sky.<br>
                Tambien, the water of la mer.<br>
                Both [eris?] and fire in their loving.<br>
                Shouldst such a place be found for them to be together.<br>
                shall it be here.<br>
                I shall strive to make anywhere for the sun and sky,<br>
                so that [there?] may see where perhaps<br>
                it could be<br>
                You and I
            </p>
            <h2>10.</h2>
            <p>
                Such love, such words.<br>
                Like the oil in the water by the shops<br>
                'tis but a mess, yet filled with beauty.<br>
                you my dear, as much as you seem to<br>
                have been daft, a wee jest per se, I shall see<br>
                you colours shimmering and shifting in the puddle.

                The clouds in the sky,<br>
                the geese are a-gandering.<br>
                The photos on the door,<br>
                mine hart is a-fluttering.<br>
                Le chat yells for thee,<br>
                but our eyes and words are locked.<br>
                I love you to the moon and back,<br>
                to the edge o' the universe thrice,<br>
                for &aelig;ternell time and evermore.

                A light flickers in the shimmering sky,<br>
                the wind and sea speak close to my window.<br>
                I wish to care for thee, look after thee,<br>
                to make sure all for thee is perfect.<br>
                Alas, distance 'tyet time keeps me away.<br>
                The spots of dead, the rides of long,<br>
                the passage of time,<br>
                I would go through them infinitely many times,<br>
                if it only meant to see thee but one more time.<br>
                Pour moi? C'est pas la mer, c'est pas le mort.<br>
                Ce n'est pas rien that stop me seeing you<br>
                ut I could make you,<br>
                just a little bit happier.
