        <h1>Home</h1>
        <p>
            In this home page I will quickly outline the different pages.
            <br>
            These pages are as follows:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The Words page. This is where I will simply list a few key phrases that I either use lots or find important to me and give their translation and their pronunciation in IPA.</li>
                <li>The Poem page. I will write down, more rather transcribe, all poems written by me (I compose them by hand with a paper and writing insturment). I will not provide full english translations</li>
                <li>The Home page. Is this somewhat self-referential? Yes, most certainly so. However, it's really just used to a) fill space and b) it's v good.</li>
            </ul>
